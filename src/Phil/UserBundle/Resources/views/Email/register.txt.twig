Hello {{ user.getFirstname }} {{ user.getLastname }},

Thank you for registering at my site. In order to complete your registration you must confirm your e-mail address. Doing this is easy and can be done in one of two ways. Firstly, you can just follow this link: {{ url('user_activate', { 'userID': user.getID, 'activationCode': user.getActivationCode }) }}

Your other option is to go to {{ url('user_activate', { 'userID': user.getID }) }} and enter your code into the box provided. Your code is: {{ user.getActivationCode }}

Once you have completed these steps you can login at {{ url('login') }} with your username {{ user.getUsername }}.

If you did not register at {{ url('PhilCMSBundle_content_default') }}  then you can ignore this e-mail and your e-mail will be removed from our databases within 30 days.

Thanks again!
